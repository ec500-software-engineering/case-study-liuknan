## Chosen Project: Keras<br>
### Technology and Platform used for development
* Keras is a fully Python program. Since Kears is a user friendly program and provide lots of APIs for users, I do not think it would use another language if it was started today. Python is the best choice.

* It has no build systems and you could just run it with any Python IDE.

* For libraries, it uses numpy and pyyaml. Users also need to install one program like TensorFlow, Theano or CNTK.
